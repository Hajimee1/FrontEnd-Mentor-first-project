## QR Code Component

This is the first project I’ve completed on Frontend Mentor.  
It is my starting point in improving my frontend skills from scratch.

I will place two images here: one showing the desktop view and one showing the mobile view.

This is a simple beginner-level project that displays on two different screen sizes.  
The design is a copy of the Figma layout provided in the `.fig` file included with the challenge.
